use fastapi to implement an AIGC PoC

First, we will start by installing FastAPI and setting up the project directory:

Copy code
pip install fastapi
mkdir aigc-poc
cd aigc-poc
Next, we will create a file called main.py and import the necessary libraries:

Copy code
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()
Now, we will define a model for the data that we want to receive in our API. In this case, we will accept a list of integers and a target integer:

Copy code
class InputData(BaseModel):
    integers: List[int]
    target: int
Next, we will create a route for our API and define a function to handle the request. This function will implement the AIGC algorithm to find the two integers in the list that sum to the target value:

Copy code
@app.post("/aigc")
def aigc(data: InputData):
    integers = data.integers
    target = data.target
    
    # Implement AIGC algorithm here
    # Find the two integers in the list that sum to the target value
    # Return the indices of the two integers
    
    return {"indices": [index1, index2]}
Finally, we will start the API by running uvicorn main:app --reload in the terminal.

To test the API, we can send a POST request with a JSON body containing the list of integers and the target value. The API should return the indices of the two integers that sum to the target value.

For example:

Copy code
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"integers": [1, 3, 5, 7, 9], "target": 8}' http://localhost:8000/aigc
Should return:

Copy code
{"indices": [0, 3]}
