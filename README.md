A web3 mediawiki is a type of online encyclopedia that uses web3 technology to enable users to access and contribute content using decentralized applications (dApps) built on blockchain platforms. This type of mediawiki would allow users to interact with the encyclopedia using their own blockchain-based digital identities, and could potentially offer enhanced security, transparency, and decentralization compared to traditional mediawikis.

As a proof-of-concept for a web3 mediawiki, one could create a simple dApp that allows users to access and edit a small collection of articles using their digital identities. The dApp could utilize a blockchain platform such as Ethereum to store the articles and track user edits, allowing users to view a history of changes and verify the authenticity of the content. The dApp could also implement smart contract-based rules to govern user behavior and ensure the integrity of the encyclopedia.

Overall, a web3 mediawiki has the potential to revolutionize the way online encyclopedias are created and maintained by leveraging the power of decentralized technology. However, more research and development is needed to fully realize the potential of this concept.
