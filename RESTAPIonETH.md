write an  ETH blockchain based RESTful API 

To write an ETH blockchain based RESTful API, you will need to follow these steps:

Set up an Ethereum node: In order to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, you will need to set up an Ethereum node and sync it with the blockchain. You can do this by installing Ethereum software such as Geth or Parity on your server.
Install a web framework: You will need a web framework to create your API. Some popular options for building RESTful APIs in Ethereum are Flask, Django, and Express.js.
Design your API endpoints: Decide what functionality you want your API to provide and create endpoints for each of these features. For example, you might create an endpoint for submitting transactions, querying the balance of an address, or retrieving the history of a particular contract.
Write the code for your API: Use the web framework and Ethereum library (such as Web3.js) to write the code for your API endpoints. You will need to handle routing, parsing HTTP requests and responses, and interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
Test your API: Make sure to test your API thoroughly to ensure that it is working as expected and is secure.
Deploy your API: Once you have completed development and testing, you can deploy your API to a server to make it available to users.
Note that this is just a high-level overview of the process of creating an ETH blockchain based RESTful API. There are many more details and considerations involved in each step. It is recommended that you familiarize yourself with Ethereum and web development concepts before embarking on this project.
