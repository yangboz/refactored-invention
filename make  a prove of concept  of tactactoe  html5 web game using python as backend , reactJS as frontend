To create a Tic Tac Toe game using Python as a backend and ReactJS as a frontend, you will need to follow these steps:

Set up a development environment: Install Python and ReactJS on your machine. You can use any code editor or IDE of your choice.
Create the backend: Start by creating a Python Flask server to handle the game's logic. You will need to create routes to handle game initialization, player moves, and game status checks.
Create the frontend: Use ReactJS to create a user interface for the game. You can use any styling library of your choice, such as Bootstrap or MaterialUI, to make the game look more appealing.
Connect the backend and frontend: Use Axios to make HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend to update the game state.
Test the game: Make sure that the game works as expected by playing it yourself and testing it with other people.
Here is an example code for creating the Tic Tac Toe game using Python and ReactJS:

Backend (Python Flask):

python
Copy code
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
import random

app = Flask(__name__)

games = {}

# Route to initialize a new game
@app.route('/game', methods=['POST'])
def new_game():
    game_id = random.randint(1, 1000)
    games[game_id] = {'board': [' ']*9, 'player': 'X'}
    return jsonify({'game_id': game_id})

# Route to make a move
@app.route('/game/<int:game_id>/move', methods=['POST'])
def make_move(game_id):
    game = games[game_id]
    board = game['board']
    player = game['player']
    move = request.json['move']

    if board[move] != ' ':
        return jsonify({'message': 'Invalid move'})

    board[move] = player
    game['player'] = 'O' if player == 'X' else 'X'

    winner = check_winner(board)
    if winner:
        return jsonify({'message': f'{winner} wins!'})
    elif ' ' not in board:
        return jsonify({'message': 'Tie game'})

    return jsonify({'board': board, 'player': game['player']})

# Function to check for a winner
def check_winner(board):
    win_positions = [[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8], [0, 3, 6], [1, 4, 7],
